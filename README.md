# HyperCartridge

Multiplayer NFT Application Cartridges!

HyperCartridge allows you to mint collaborative applications into an NFT and serve them via an ENS domain.

Each HyperCartridge NFT encapsulates the logic and state for an application that can be served from the NFT to a user. A HyperCartridge can be single player, or multiplayer by optionally specifying a server to run their state logic.

Each HyperCartridge NFT is comprised of the HyperCartridge kernel, application logic, and metadata such as the ENS domain and server.
